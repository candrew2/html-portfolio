        <!--Paragraph About Me-->
        <p>
            I have little to no background in the Computer Science field, 
            but it has been the goal for my Career and Degree for years. 
            I love playing video games and want to furthur explore the Computer Science field 
            on my own time, as it could help me grow and practice for a future career.

        <p>
            I have some programming projects from my time in CS136, 
            although they are imperfect, a couple of them were:<br>
            <br>
            1. <b>Hangman</b> - A project coded in C for an assignment in which 
            the user had the ability to guess a letter which was checked against
            the randomly chosen word and if the letter wasn't in the word 
            the user would get a strike.<br>

            <img src="./Hangman SS2.png" width="400" height="500" alt="Hangman Execution Example"/><br>
            2. <b>Battleship</b> - Another project coded in C for an assignment in which 
            the user would describe a position and that would be checked against 
            an array with randomly determined ships and if they missed an 'X' would be 
            added to their guessed position, and if there was a ship an 'O' was added to their 'map.'<br>

            <img src="./Battleship SS2.png" width="400" height="500" alt="Battleship Execution Fail"/>
