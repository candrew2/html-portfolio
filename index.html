        <!--Paragraph About Me-->
        <p>
            I have little to no background in the Computer Science field, 
            but it has been the goal for my Career and Degree for years. 
            I love playing video games and want to furthur explore the Computer Science field 
            on my own time, as it could help me grow and practice for a future career.

        <h3><u>My Experience and Projects</u></h3>
        <!--Projects Section-->
        <p>
            I have some programming projects from my time in CS136, 
            although they are imperfect, a couple of them were:<br>
            <br>
            1. <b>Hangman</b> - A project coded in C for an assignment in which 
            the user had the ability to guess a letter which was checked against
            the randomly chosen word and if the letter wasn't in the word 
            the user would get a strike.<br>
            2. <b>Battleship</b> - Another project coded in C for an assignment in which 
            the user would describe a position and that would be checked against 
            an array with randomly determined ships and if they missed an 'X' would be 
            added to their guessed position, and if there was a ship an 'O' was added to their 'map.'
        </p>
        <!--Experience Heading-->
        <h3><u>My Education and Experience</u></h3>
        <!--Experience Section-->
        <p>
            <b>Primary Education</b> - Attended the same two schools for middle and high school 
            until currently being in my second year at NAU. <br>
            I was an Honor Roll and Principal's List student throughout my middle and high school years, being the 15th place in my graduating class. 
            Before college I rarely had struggles in classes and didn't need to study or apply effort, which I quickly learned was not going to get 
            me by for college.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Work Experience</b> - I mainly have work experience in the food industry 
            with two years of experience working at an Arby's and a year of experience at Buffalo Wild Wings
            in the kitchen (ongoing).<br>
